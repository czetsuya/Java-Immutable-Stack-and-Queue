# JImmutable Queue

Immutable Stack and Queue implementation in Java Programming Language. 

A Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data
structure. It supports two basic operations called push and pop. The push
operation adds an element at the top of the stack, and the pop operation
removes an element from the top of the stack.

Example stack of integers: 1, 2, 3. If we push these integer in order we will
get:

```sh
1
2
3
```

Invoking pop will return 1 or the last element entered.

A Queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data
structure. It supports two basic operations called enQueue and deQueue. The
enQueue operation adds an element at the beginning of the queue, and the
deQueue operation removes an element from the end of the queue.

Example queue of integers: 1, 2, 3. If we queue these integer in order we
will get:

```sh
1 -> 2 -> 3
```

Invoking deQueue will return 3 or the first element entered.tion adds an element at the beginning of the queue, and the deQueue operation removes an element from the end of the queue.
